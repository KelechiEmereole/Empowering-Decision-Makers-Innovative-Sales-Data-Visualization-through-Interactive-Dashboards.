## Introduction

In today's competitive business environment, data-driven decision-making is essential for optimizing sales performance. This project focuses on ClearX, leveraging Excel to build an interactive sales dashboard that provides actionable insights into revenue, customer demographics, and marketing effectiveness.

The dashboard consolidates key metrics—including N32M revenue, 750K units sold, and N4.4M profit—into a single, user-friendly interface. By using Excel's robust features like PivotTables, charts, and conditional formatting, this project demonstrates how accessible tools can deliver powerful business intelligence.

## Project Aim

The goal of this project is to create an Excel-based sales dashboard that enables ClearX to:

* Track total revenue, profit, and units sold across product categories

* Analyze customer demographics (age groups, gender distribution)

* Evaluate branch-specific marketing performance

* Monitor monthly/yearly sales trends

* Support data-driven decisions with interactive filters

## Project Description

This Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive view of ClearX's sales operations, featuring:

* Financial Overview: Total revenue (N32M), profit (N4.4M), and unit sales (750K)
* Product Performance: Revenue breakdown by category
* Customer Insights: Top buying age groups and gender trends
* Marketing Analysis: Branch-wise strategy effectiveness
* Trend Analysis: Monthly and yearly sales patterns

Built using PivotTables, charts, and slicers, the dashboard allows dynamic filtering for deeper analysis.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation

## Insights and Interpretation

### 1. Product Category Performance
ClearX’s revenue is evenly distributed across product categories, with Makeup leading at ₦6.46M (20.1% share), closely followed by Accessories (₦6.43M), Fragrances (₦6.42M), Haircare (₦6.41M), and Skincare (₦6.37M). This balance suggests stable demand across all segments, though Makeup’s slight edge could be leveraged for cross-promotions or premium pricing.

### 2. Customer Demographics
Age Groups:
The 28-38 and 49-59 age groups are ClearX’s highest spenders, generating ₦7.38M and ₦7.28M respectively. Meanwhile, customers aged 60+ contribute significantly less (₦4.03M), indicating potential to tailor products or marketing for younger demographics.

### Gender Trends:
Revenue is nearly identical between genders (Female: ₦16.01M, Male: ₦16.08M), but men purchase slightly more frequently (79,283 vs. 78,427 transactions). This could inspire gender-specific loyalty programs or product bundling.

### 3. Geographic Insights
Sales are consistent across locations: Rural (₦10.73M), City (₦10.70M), and Suburb (₦10.66M). Rural areas marginally outperform despite similar customer counts, hinting at untapped potential in suburban markets through localized campaigns.

### 4. Sales Trends & Seasonality
August was the strongest month (₦3.15M), followed by July (₦3M)

January underperformed (₦2.16M) despite typical post-holiday demand

February unexpectedly strong (₦2.96M) – investigate replicable factors

Steady growth from May (₦2.79M) to August peak (+13%)

Year-over-year growth is stagnant (2021: ₦16.04M → 2022: ₦16.05M), highlighting a need for strategic interventions.

## Recommendations

### 1. Product Optimization
Leverage Makeup's leadership by creating premium bundles with Fragrances (top 3 category)

Develop gender-specific kits (e.g., "Men's Grooming Sets" for male shoppers) to capitalize on purchase frequency

Test skincare-haircare combos to boost the lowest-performing category (₦6.37M)

### 2. Targeted Marketing Initiatives
Focus on high-spending age groups:

Launch "Prime Years" loyalty program for 28-38 and 49-59 demographics

Create age-specific product collections (e.g., "30s Skincare Solutions")

Enhance suburban outreach:

Partner with local influencers in underperforming suburbs

Test pop-up shops in high-footfall suburban locations

### 3. Seasonal Strategy Overhaul
Summer Growth Program (May-August):

Scale up inventory and staffing for the 13% demand surge

Introduce "Summer Essentials" limited editions

January Recovery Plan:

Implement post-holiday "New Year Refresh" campaigns

Offer bundled clearance deals with free gifts

February Success Replication:

Analyze winning strategies (promotions? inventory?)

Develop "February Favorites" based on top sellers

### 4. Growth Acceleration
Stagnancy Breakthrough:

Introduce 3-5 new premium products in Makeup/Accessories

Launch referral program with tiered rewards

Rural Expansion:

Open 2-3 new distribution centers in top rural areas

Develop "Rural Exclusive" product variants

### 5. Data-Driven Execution
Monthly Performance Reviews:

Track impact of new strategies by demographic/region

Adjust tactics based on real-time sales data

A/B Testing:

Test different bundling approaches by location

Experiment with age-targeted digital ads
