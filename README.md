Project Overview:  I created this dashboard to empower decision-makers with clear and actionable sales insights. 

Business Overview/Problem
CLEARX Cosmetics faces a significant business challenge in effectively monitoring and optimizing its sales performance across its branches. The key obstacles the company encounters include:
 
A. Data Fragmentation: Sales data is collected manually across the two branches, leading to fragmented, error-prone records.
 
B. Limited Data Analysis: The lack of data analysis tools hinders the company's ability to gain insights into product performance, customer preferences, and regional trends.
 
C. Resource Allocation: CLEARX Cosmetics struggles to allocate resources efficiently, leading to stockouts or overstock situations.

Insights: 
- The 28-38 and 49-59 age brackets seem to be the top purchasers. The 60 and above age group has the least purchasing activity.
- Makeup and accessories are the leading categories in terms of revenue, skincare generated the least revenue.
- Males contribute significantly more to revenue and has a higher purchase frequency compared to females.
